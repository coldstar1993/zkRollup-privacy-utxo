# Architecture
Anomix Network is a layer2 Of Mina, based on UTXO account model, with capabilities to make your fund operations private, anonymous and un-tracable.

Within Anomix Network, you will get a totally new L2 account derived from L1 account, and any one could not link L2 account with L1 account util it obtains the private key of L1 account, meaning any of your operations in Anomix Network could neither be linked with L1 account.

With aid of Anomix Network, you could benefit from `anonymous & priate` fund operations, such as `depositing fund from L1, withdrawing fund to L1, transferring fund to any one within L2`, etc. No body could trace your funds circulation, because all sensitive parts about your operations happen on your local devices (leveraging zero knowledge proof) and all your status info are also stored within L2 network under solid encryption.

Based on UTXO account model, all your behaviors including account management & fund operations are via `Note` pattern within Anomix Network. 
* account management is via `account notes`
* fund operations are via `value notes`
